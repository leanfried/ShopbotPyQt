    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    
    <p>This software was written for Windows. Certain elements, like folder opening buttons <img src="../pythonGUI/icons/link.png" class="icon2"> and the system that tracks whether the pressure should be on or off during prints, will break outside of Windows.</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Install Python</li>
        <ul>
            <li>For example, install <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Miniconda</a></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Download the software from <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/ShopbotPyQt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Github</a>. Because this software is continually updated, you can keep the most updated version of the code by cloning the repository through Github. For beginners:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Download <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Github desktop</a></li>
            <li>Create a <a href="https://github.com/join" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Github account</a></li>
            <li>In Github desktop, clone <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/ShopbotPyQt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the ShopbotPyQt repository</a></li>
            <li>To update your software to the latest version, click "Fetch Origin" in Github Desktop at any time.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Install <a href="https://www.shopbottools.com/support/control-software">the Shopbot control software</a></li>
        <ul>
            <li> By default, the Shopbot control software shows 4 output flags, but it allows 12. To increase the number of visible output flags for signaling additional devices (e.g. pressure channels, lights, etc.), go into Move/Cut Mode. Once in Move/Cut - right click in the input/output section of the red position window. Here you can set the number of inputs/outputs displayed up to 12 in the red window</li>
            <li>You will need to start up Shopbot independently the first time. For the pop-up message that occurs, check the box to not show the message again. Load all the setting you will need into shopbot at this time. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <li>Install <a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura">Ultimaker Cura</a> slicer. Save it to the system's 'program files' folder</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a free ultimaker account</li>
            <li>Once downloaded and opened, go to the setting tab and add printer. Under the 'add a non-networked printer', there should be a 'custom' option with a drop down menu. Click on the 'Custom FFF printer' and rename it to your preference.</li>
            <li>A 'machine setting' window should pop up, where you will place corresponding variables to the printer.</li>

            <li>Set the print resolution to extra coarse - 0.6mm and unclick the Adhesion box and Support box in the same window</li>
            <li>Within the print settings 'Custom', make certain the 'Infill' section's density is set to 0.0, the 'Support' section's Generate Support box is unchecked, and the 'Build Plate Adhesion' type is set to None. </li>
            <li>Essentially, any supports for the structure are redundant as it is already supported in the bath. It will only cause excess ink to be extruded and ruin your print.</li>
            <li>Note that the Cura slicer takes 1/3 inch, or about 8.46mm, off the edges, so you can add that much to the X/Y/Z measurements. However, measurements of 41.66mm x 41.66mm x 92.46mm will have you go past the container dimensions, as those hit the stage walls.
</li>
            <li>When creating an STL file through <a href="https://www.onshape.com/en/">Onshape</a>, create measurements in millimeters, even if it states in inches. Cura assumes all measurements are in millimeters.</li>

        <p>The conversion window can currently take in both STL and GCODE files to be converted into an SBP file. However, if an STL file is inserted, the GUI will only open the Cura slicer. You must first create the GCODE file, save it, and then choose the file within the GUI.</p>
        <li>To add a file to convert, click the "Load File" button. The file name will then be displayed.</li>
        <li>If there is a need to change the name of the save file, you can update it within the textbox for 'saving file under name of'. </li>
        <li>To save the SBP file to the same location as the original file, click the 'save to file folder' button. Otherwise, a new save location can be selected by clicking the 'choose save location' button. You cannot choose a save location while the checkbox is selected.</li>
        <li>To change between flow channels for the resulting sbp file, select between radio buttons "Channel 0" and "Channel 1"</li>
        <li>To add the SBP file to the Shopbot queue, click the 'load to queue after conversion' checkbox.</li>
        <li>To run the conversion on the selected file, click the 'convert file' button. The window should close automatically.</li>
        <li>If you exit out of the window accidentally, the window keeps all previous settings. This includes when there is a successful conversion.</li>
        <p>Currently, the conversion program must override a method within sbprint.py that obtains the flow speed. As a result, set target speed in the speed calibration tool between 1 and 10 to start with, and adjust from there. </p>

        <p>Each time a new ink is loaded onto the printer, the pressure should be calibrated. Pressures can vary based on ink rheology, length of tubing, and pinch points in the tubing. The calibration process is as follows:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Load ink of known density onto printer. Start flow until the tubing is completely full, and ink is exiting the nozzle.</li>
            <li>If you have previously saved the density for this fluid, select the sample from the "Load density" menu. If you type the beginning of the sample name into the "Sample" field, it will narrow the "Load density" list down to samples that start with that value. Selecting an ink loads the Sample name and Density</li>
            <li>If you have not previously loaded the density for this fluid, fill in the "Sample" and "Density" fields. Clicking "Save" will store this new density in the density.yml file in the configs folder, so it will be available the next time you load the sample</li>
            <li>Fill in the nozzle inner diameter.</li>
            <li>Fill in the target flow speed</li>
            <li>Mass the container. Fill in "init wt" in row 1. Place container under nozzle.</li>
            <li>In the Fluigent module, put a pressure, e.g. 100, into the "Set pressure" box. Put a time, e.g. 15, into the "fixed time" box. Press "Go", next to the fixed time box. This will turn on the pressure to, e.g. 100 mBar for 15 seconds, then turn it off. It will automatically put the values for pressure and time into the top available row in the calibration table.</li>
            <li>Mass the container. Fill in "final wt" in row 1. This will automatically fill in the "speed" value for row 1 and plot it on the graph.</li>
            <li>Repeat previous 3 steps at varying pressures, filling in rows 2 and beyond until the calibration curve no longer shifts with additional points.</li>
            <li>When you are done with calibration, click "Use this pressure". This will take the "Pressure" value for the given target speed and fill the pressure into the "Shopbot" module, so Channel 1 will turn to that pressure during printing. You can also fill this value in manually in the "Shopbot" module.</li>
            <li>Click "Save" to save the entire calibration table and metadata to the export folder designated in "Settings"<img src="../pythonGUI/icons/settings.png" class="icon2"> </li>

It is recommended that the time format include the date, since the date will not otherwise be added to file names. Use the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-strftime-function/">Python strftime format.</a></li>
            <li>Duplicate suffix is the format to use if there is already an file with the name that you are requesting, and the program needs to add a suffix to the filename to avoid overwriting the existing file. {0:0=3d} adds a 3 digit counter to the end, e.g. 012</li>
            <li>Separator is the character to place in between parts of the file name. E.g. "_" might produce a file called "[Shopbot file name]_[device]_[date].[extension]", and "-" would produce a file called "[Shopbot file name]-[device]-[date].[extension]". </li>
            <li>A sample file name is provided at the bottom of the page and should automatically update.</li>
