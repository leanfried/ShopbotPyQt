        <p>This page describes two nozzle designs, one for conventional printing and one for direct ink writing with acoustophoresis. Both use a pneumatic mass flow controller to extrude ink out of a reservoir.</p>

        <p> In Direct Ink Writing, there are many types of nozzles you could use. Here are a few:</p>

        <div style="display:block; overflow:auto"><img style="float:left" src="img/syringe_pump.png" alt="A syringe pump. A gray box with buttons and a screen holds onto a plastic syringe. Part of the gray box presses on the plunger of the syringe to control flow. A tube is attached to the end of the syringe, and on the other end of the tube, a blue fitting hangs loose. Next to the blue fitting is a yellow needle, which can fit onto the blue fitting." class="graphic" ><div style="float:left; max-width:400px" ><ul><li>A syringe pump, which can control the flow rate of ink out of a syringe, through a tube, through a nozzle. These can control the flow rate directly, but can experience transients that make it difficult to make quick moves.</li></ul></div></div>

        <div style="display:block; overflow:auto"><img style="float:left" src="img/pneumatic_direct_dispenser.png" alt="A direct dispensing pump. The body is shaped like a jumbo Sharpie, with a nozzle shaped like a fine-tipped Sharpie tip." class="graphic" ><div style="float:left; max-width:400px" ><ul><li><a href="http://www.nscrypt.com/smartpump/">Pneumatic direct dispensing pumps</a>, where you fill a reservoir with ink, and a pump applies pressure to the ink, causing it to flow directly out of the reservoir through a nozzle. I have never used one of these systems, so I can't comment on how it is to work with these, but they are advertised as having very fine control over starts and stops, over a wide range of ink viscosities.</li></ul></div></div>

        <div style="display:block; overflow:auto"><img style="float:left" src="img/fluigent.jpg" alt="A pneumatic mass flow controller. On the left is a kiwi-sized flow unit, which measures flow rates. Next is a blue block with a button on front and two data ports on top. Attached to the blue block is a slightly larger blue block with a knob, two buttons, and a button that says P=0, a plug on the left, and a tubing hole on top. On the right side of the image is a plastic conical Falcon tube with an adapter on top with two tubing holes." class="graphic" ><div style="float:left; max-width:400px" ><ul><li><a href="https://www.fluigent.com/product/microfluidic-components-3/lineup-series/">A pneumatic mass flow controller.</a> You fill a reservoir with ink, and a pump applies air at a fixed pressure to the reservoir, causing ink to flow out through a tube, which is connected to a nozzle. This is the design that I have used the most. The disadvantages of these systems are that you have to separately calibrate the flow rate of your ink to the requested pressure instead of just plugging in a flow rate, and they can't extrude very viscous inks. However, mass flow controllers have faster starts and stops than syringe pumps and allow for more flexibility and customization at the nozzle end than direct dispensing pumps. As a result, pneumatic mass flow controllers are useful for research applications, low viscosity inks, and custom 3D printer designs.</li></ul></div></div>
