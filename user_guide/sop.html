When the handle is up, the pressure is on. When it is forward, the pressure is off. The pipe connects to a regulator that should be at 7 bar. After the regulator, the line splits. One line comes forward towards you through another regulator, which goes to the rheometer. Another line splits off to the side as soft tubing, which then winds up the table to another air dryer to the Fluigent."></td>
