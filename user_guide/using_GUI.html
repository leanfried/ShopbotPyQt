        <p>The conversion window can currently take in both STL and GCODE files to be converted into an SBP file. However, if an STL file is inserted, the GUI will only open the Cura slicer. You must first create the GCODE file, save it, and then choose the file within the GUI.</p>
        <li>To add a file to convert, click the "Load File" button. The file name will then be displayed.</li>
        <li>If there is a need to change the name of the save file, you can update it within the textbox for 'saving file under name of'. </li>
        <li>To save the SBP file to the same location as the original file, click the 'save to file folder' button. Otherwise, a new save location can be selected by clicking the 'choose save location' button. You cannot choose a save location while the checkbox is selected.</li>
        <li>To change between flow channels for the resulting sbp file, select between radio buttons "Channel 0" and "Channel 1"</li>
        <li>To add the SBP file to the Shopbot queue, click the 'load to queue after conversion' checkbox.</li>
        <li>To run the conversion on the selected file, click the 'convert file' button. The window should close automatically.</li>
        <li>If you exit out of the window accidentally, the window keeps all previous settings. This includes when there is a successful conversion.</li>
        <p>Currently, the conversion program must override a method within sbprint.py that obtains the flow speed. As a result, set target speed in the speed calibration tool between 1 and 10 to start with, and adjust from there. </p>

        <p>Each time a new ink is loaded onto the printer, the pressure should be calibrated. Pressures can vary based on ink rheology, length of tubing, and pinch points in the tubing. The calibration process is as follows:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Load ink of known density onto printer. Start flow until the tubing is completely full, and ink is exiting the nozzle.</li>
            <li>If you have previously saved the density for this fluid, select the sample from the "Load density" menu. If you type the beginning of the sample name into the "Sample" field, it will narrow the "Load density" list down to samples that start with that value. Selecting an ink loads the Sample name and Density</li>
            <li>If you have not previously loaded the density for this fluid, fill in the "Sample" and "Density" fields. Clicking "Save" will store this new density in the density.yml file in the configs folder, so it will be available the next time you load the sample</li>
            <li>Fill in the nozzle inner diameter.</li>
            <li>Fill in the target flow speed</li>
            <li>Mass the container. Fill in "init wt" in row 1. Place container under nozzle.</li>
            <li>In the Fluigent module, put a pressure, e.g. 100, into the "Set pressure" box. Put a time, e.g. 15, into the "fixed time" box. Press "Go", next to the fixed time box. This will turn on the pressure to, e.g. 100 mBar for 15 seconds, then turn it off. It will automatically put the values for pressure and time into the top available row in the calibration table.</li>
            <li>Mass the container. Fill in "final wt" in row 1. This will automatically fill in the "speed" value for row 1 and plot it on the graph.</li>
            <li>Repeat previous 3 steps at varying pressures, filling in rows 2 and beyond until the calibration curve no longer shifts with additional points.</li>
            <li>When you are done with calibration, click "Use this pressure". This will take the "Pressure" value for the given target speed and fill the pressure into the "Shopbot" module, so Channel 1 will turn to that pressure during printing. You can also fill this value in manually in the "Shopbot" module.</li>
            <li>Click "Save" to save the entire calibration table and metadata to the export folder designated in "Settings"<img src="../pythonGUI/icons/settings.png" class="icon2"> </li>

    <p>The Shopbot module uses a file queue. The current file is marked with a "Play" <img src="../pythonGUI/icons/play.png" class="icon2"> icon. The "Play" <img src="../pythonGUI/icons/play.png" class="icon2"> button sends the current file to the SB3 Shopbot program, which runs the file. Once the file is done, the current file proceeds to the next file. You can use the settings <img src="../pythonGUI/icons/settings.png" class="icon2">  menu to determine whether to autoplay the next file or wait for the user to press play again.<p>
        <ul>
            <li>To add files to the end of the queue, click the "load" <img src="../pythonGUI/icons/open.png" class="icon2"> button. You can load multiple files at once. To load the same file multiple times, you must use the "load"s button multiple times.</li>
            <li>To remove files, click once on each file, then click the "remove" <img src="../pythonGUI/icons/delete.png" class="icon2"> button.</li>
            <li>To re-order the files, click and drag.</li>
            <li>To select a file as the current file to send to the Shopbot, double click on the file.</li>
            <li>To set the pressure that the pressure controller goes to during printing, use the "pressure during print" box. This can be filled in using the "Use this pressure" button in the speed calibration tool or filled in manually.</li>

        <img src="img/software_settings_shopbot.png" class="graphic" alt="The Shopbot tab of the settings window. There are options for autoplaying files and setting the Shopbot file source folder.">
        
        <p>In the settings menu, the user can decide whether or not to autoplay files. You can either automatically start the next file once the first Shopbot file is done, or you can wait for the user to press play on each Shopbot file.</p>
        
        <p>The folder that opens when the user clicks the "load" <img src="../pythonGUI/icons/open.png" class="icon2"> button on the main Shopbot module can be set via the settings. The "load" <img src="../pythonGUI/icons/open.png" class="icon2"> button sets the Shopbot file folder.

            <li>To create an extra date subfolder inside of the sample folder, such that the folder will be "[Sample]/[Date]", select "Include date: As sample folder name".</li>
            <li>To only put the sample name in the folder and have no separate folder for each date, such that the folder will be "[Sample]", select "Include date: in no folder name".</li>
            <li>To include the time in the file name, select, "Include time: in file name"</li>
            <li>To include the shopbot .sbp file name in the sample folder name, such that the folder name will be "[Sample]_[Date]_[ShopbotFile]", select "Include SB file name: In sample folder name".</li>

            <li>To include the shopbot .sbp file name in the file names, (e.g. a video file will be labeled by what shopbot file was being printed), select "Include SB file name: in file name"</li>
            <li>To change how the date is formatted in file names and folder names, change the "Date format" box. Use the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-strftime-function/">Python strftime format.</a></li>
            <li>To change how the time is formatted in file names and folder names, change the "Time format" box. It is recommended that the time format include the date, since the date will not otherwise be added to file names. Use the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-strftime-function/">Python strftime format.</a></li>
            <li>Duplicate suffix is the format to use if there is already an file with the name that you are requesting, and the program needs to add a suffix to the filename to avoid overwriting the existing file. {0:0=3d} adds a 3 digit counter to the end, e.g. 012</li>
            <li>Separator is the character to place in between parts of the file name. E.g. "_" might produce a file called "[Shopbot file name]_[device]_[date].[extension]", and "-" would produce a file called "[Shopbot file name]-[device]-[date].[extension]". </li>
            <li>A sample file name is provided at the bottom of the page and should automatically update.</li>
