    <h1>Safety</h1>
    <h2>Personal Protective Equipment</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Safety glasses</b> at all times. This is necessary just to be in the lab, but it also protects the user from mechanical equipment hazards, pressurized fluid hazards, and any hazardous materials being printed.</li> 
        <li><b>Lab coat</b>, at appropriate rating for materials used. This is required if handling hazardous materials and recommended for non-hazardous materials, as the printing process involves fluids under pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Gloves</b>, at appropriate rating for materials used. This is required if handling hazardous materials, recommended for non-hazardous materials for tasks like cleaning the nozzle, and recommended during any other interaction with the interior of the printer, to protect the user from any potential hazardous residues.</li>
        <li><b>Laser safety glasses</b>, rated for 365 nm at 2.8 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, if doing maintenance on the UV lamp which could lead to eye exposure.</li> 
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Safe operating</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Do not stick your body parts into the printer while the gantry is moving or while a print is running.</li>
        <li>Keep the enclosure closed while the air pressure is on, to protect yourself from splatters.</li>
        <li>Only use equipment rated for the pressures you are going to use in the pressure system. This includes conical tubes, tubing, fittings, and nozzles. If the line clogs, do not increase the pressure. Breaks in the ink dispensing line could lead to ink being sprayed all over the printer.</li>
        <li>Do not drain the ink reservoir all the way to zero. This will cause ink to splatter out of the nozzle tip.</li>
        <li>Do not look directly into any LED.</li>
        <li>Do not look at the light coming out of the UV lamp. Keep the enclosure closed while using the UV lamp. Always make sure that the UV lamp is off before opening the enclosure. If the software crashes while the UV lamp is on, and the lamp remains on, the lamp needs to be turned off using the physical on/off button.</li>
    </ol>
